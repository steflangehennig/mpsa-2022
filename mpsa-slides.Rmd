# Committee Policy Influence

- What is the role and authority of congressional committees in influencing federal policy?

- A measure of how influential each committee is among various issue areas in federal policy over time does not exist

- Using the United States Code, we propose a **_committee influence score_** that gauges the policy influence of
committees at a more granular level

# United States Code (USC)

- Comprised of "general and permanent laws of the United States", broadly organized by subject matter into several dozen titles

- Contents of public law are categorized hierarchically using the Statutes at Large compiled at the end of each congressional session

  - Titles, subtitles, chapters, subchapters, sections, etc.
  
- Parsed XHTML files provided by the OLRC into provision-level data spanning 1994-2018 (103rd-115th Congresses)

- Used CAP coding scheme at the chapter level to categorize ~60,000 sections within the USC's 54 titles

---

# Committee Influence Score

- Based on the linkage between public laws and sections of the US Code ("source credit")

- A House committee (or multiple committees) gets credit for influence over a USC section if the committee was referred a bill that became law and that law either enacted or amended a section

- A committee gains influence over a section starting with the earliest law referred to the committee that altered the
section

- A section may have more than one committee attributed to it

- A committee is never dropped from a section even if a different committee amends that section in a subsequent year

- If a section is dropped from the USC, it is no longer counted as an influenced section by the relevant committee(s)

# Conclusions

- The USC provides a substantial amount of information about lawmaking over time and in several policy areas

- Coupled with the CAP coding scheme, we created a committee influence score that captures the influence congressional committees have over federal policy and how this varies over time

- Our measure suggests there are no dominant committees consistently exercising control over federal policy; however, some do expand their influence, while others ebb and flow over time
